# Creating a Friday Night Funkin' Mod - Custom Characters

This chapter will walk you through the process of creating a functioning, fully compatible Friday Night Funkin' mod, using the game's official systems for loading custom content and scripts. Once your mod is complete, you will be able to place it in the `mods` folder in your game install and use its content in-game without overriding the base game content and still maintain compatibility with other mods.

This chapter goes over adding new characters to the game, and using them in a level. If you are looking for adding characters to the character select screen, see [Custom Playable Characters](../05-custom-playable-characters/05-00-custom-playable-characters.md).
