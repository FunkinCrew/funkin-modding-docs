# Migrating from v0.5.0 to v0.6.0

Migration from v0.5.0 to v0.6.0 requires only minor changes to mods, and won't break most mods.

# Migrate from hxCodec to hxvlc

The library used for video playback has changed from hxCodec to hxvlc. This has resulted in improved performance and various bug fixes overall, but breaks mods which interact directly with the video library. This should not break any mods which use the built-in system for cutscenes in Funkin'.

Make the following changes:

```haxe
// BEFORE: Imports from the package `hxcodec`
import hxcodec.flixel.FlxVideoSprite;

// AFTER: Imports from the package `hxvlc`
import hxvlc.flixel.FlxVideoSprite;


// BEFORE: Callback to onTextureSetup
video.bitmap.onTextureSetup.add(() -> { ... });

// AFTER: Callback to onFormatSetup
video.bitmap.onFormatSetup.add(() -> { ... });


// BEFORE: Play a video by path.
video.play(videoPath);

// AFTER: Load a video by path, then play if load was successful.
// You can also run video.load() in advance before playing the video.
if (video.load(videoPath)) video.play();
```
