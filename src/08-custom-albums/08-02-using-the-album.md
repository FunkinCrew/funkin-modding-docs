# Using the Album

Albums are defined on a per-song basis, so you have to set the album ID for each song. In order to do this, you first have to make the song the itself. See [Custom Songs and Custom Levels](../02-custom-songs-and-custom-levels/02-00-custom-songs-and-custom-levels.md).

When you are done creating the song, head over to the `metadata.json` of the song where you want to album to appear and check in `playData` for the `album` key.

Once the chart which references your album is in your mod folder, simply start the game with your mod installed.
